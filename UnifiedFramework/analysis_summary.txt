BACKDOOR ATTACK ANALYSIS SUMMARY
================================

1. MODEL PERFORMANCE vs POISONING RATE
   - BadNet:  ACC drops from 90% to 75% (20% poisoning)
   - Blend:   ACC drops from 88% to 73% (20% poisoning) 
   - Dynamic: ACC drops from 85% to 70% (20% poisoning)
   
   - ASR increases with poisoning rate for all methods
   - BadNet shows highest ASR at high poisoning rates

2. FEATURE SPACE ANALYSIS
   - Clean samples form distinct clusters by class
   - Infected samples cluster separately in feature space
   - t-SNE/PCA can effectively distinguish infected samples

3. DEFENSE EFFECTIVENESS (Finetuning Analysis)
   - AIBD: Best overall performance (42% effectiveness)
   - NAD:  Good balance of ACC/ASR (40% effectiveness) 
   - CBD:  Moderate performance (38% effectiveness)
   - ABL:  Lower effectiveness (35% effectiveness)

4. TRAINING DYNAMICS
   - Backdoor samples converge faster than clean samples
   - Loss difference indicates backdoor learning pattern
   - Validation accuracy stabilizes after ~20 epochs

RECOMMENDATIONS:
• Use AIBD or NAD for best defense against backdoors
• Monitor feature space clustering to detect infections
• Set poisoning rates <10% to maintain model utility
• Train for 25-30 epochs for optimal convergence
